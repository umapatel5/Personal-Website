        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         <p>
  Hi! I‚Äôm Uma, a <strong>Freelance Web Developer</strong> and Computer Science student at NYU. 
  I love creating digital experiences that are both technically sound and visually elegant. 
  My curiosity for understanding how things work drives me to explore new technologies and frameworks, 
  from front-end design to full-stack engineering.
</p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Through projects like <em>LangConv</em> and internships at <em>PGIM</em> and <em>Quantum Pulse Consulting</em>, 
          I‚Äôve developed hands-on experience in software development, automation, and data visualization. 
          I enjoy building tools that make complex ideas simple and intuitive.

    <h2>Internship Experience</h2>
    <p>
      My internships showed me that software engineering goes beyond code and is rooted in collaboration, impact, and communication.  
  At <strong>PGIM</strong>, I built Power BI dashboards and automated workflows in Power Apps,  
  helping investment teams make faster, data-driven decisions.  
  At <strong>Quantum Pulse Consulting</strong>, I focused on client communication and project coordination,  
  managing Scrum meetings, handling outreach, and supporting digital transformation initiatives for small businesses.

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
   <p>
  I‚Äôm drawn to projects that create real impact by making learning, connection, and creativity more accessible.  
  Whether it‚Äôs building a language simulator to help people practice conversation or designing a platform to support students,  
  I love using technology to solve problems that matter. I approach every project with curiosity, empathy, and a focus on thoughtful design.

    <h2>What I‚Äôm Exploring Next</h2>
    <p>
  Lately, I‚Äôve been diving deeper into <strong>AI and conversational interfaces</strong>,  
  learning how technology can make language learning, accessibility, and creativity more intuitive.  
  I‚Äôm excited by tools that blend communication, code, and design, and by how they shape the future of interaction.
