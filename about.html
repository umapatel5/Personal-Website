        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I‚Äôm Uma, a <strong>Freelance Web Developer</strong> and Computer Science student at NYU. 
          I love creating digital experiences that are both technically sound and visually elegant. 
          My curiosity for understanding how things work drives me to explore new technologies and frameworks ‚Äî 
          from front-end design to full-stack engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through projects like <em>LangConv</em> and internships at <em>PGIM</em> and <em>Quantum Pulse Consulting</em>, 
          I‚Äôve developed hands-on experience in software development, automation, and data visualization. 
          I enjoy building tools that make complex ideas simple and intuitive.

    <h2>Internship Experience</h2>
    <p>
      My internships taught me that software engineering is about <strong>people</strong> as much as it is about code. 
      At <strong>PGIM</strong>, I built Power Apps dashboards and automated investment workflows ‚Äî 
      learning how to translate financial data into real-time tools for decision-making.  
      At <strong>Quantum Pulse Consulting</strong>, I worked on website modernization projects that helped small businesses 
      strengthen their digital presence.

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm drawn to projects that combine creativity and structure. I believe in building things with purpose ‚Äî 
      software that feels human, solves real problems, and leaves room for curiosity.  
      Whether I‚Äôm managing a project or debugging an API call, I focus on learning, empathy, and clean design.

    <h2>What I‚Äôm Exploring Next</h2>
    <p>
      Lately, I‚Äôve been diving deeper into <strong>AI and conversational interfaces</strong> ‚Äî 
      learning how technology can make language learning, accessibility, and creativity more intuitive.  
      I‚Äôm excited by tools that blend communication, code, and design ‚Äî and how they shape the future of interaction.
