        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I’m Uma, a passionate <strong>Freelance Web Developer</strong> with a love for creating engaging, user-friendly websites. 
          Specializing in <strong>front-end development</strong>, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft seamless digital experiences. 
          My curiosity for understanding how things work first drew me into tech, and that curiosity continues to drive me to explore 
          new tools and frameworks across design, development, and data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m currently a <strong>Computer Science student at NYU</strong>. 
          Last year, I worked on <em>LangConv</em> — a full-stack web app that simulates language learning through real-time conversations — 
          which helped me deepen my backend, database, and API integration skills. 
          More recently, I’ve gained experience across <strong>software development, investments, and project management</strong> 
          through internships at <em>PGIM</em> and <em>Quantum Pulse Consulting</em>, where I worked on data analytics dashboards, 
          workflow automation, and cross-functional Agile sprints.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, I’m exploring design trends, sketching creative ideas, or working on projects that blend 
          <strong>technology, creativity, and real-world problem solving</strong>. 
          With a growth mindset and a love for learning, I’m always seeking new opportunities to refine my skills 
          and contribute to meaningful, impactful work.
        </p>
