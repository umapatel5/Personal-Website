        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I’m Uma, a passionate Freelance Web Developer with a love for creating engaging, user-friendly websites. Specializing in front-end development, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft seamless digital experiences. My journey into the tech world began with a fascination for understanding how things work, which has led me to explore various programming languages and frameworks to expand my technical expertise.        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently a student at NYU and an active member of Tech@NYU, where I collaborate with like-minded peers to tackle innovative projects. Last semester, I built a full-stack website called "LangConv", designed to simplify language learning through real-time conversation simulations. This project allowed me to dive deeper into backend development and strengthen my skills in database management and API integration.

        </p>
        <p>
            When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends, sketching creative ideas, or working on personal projects that merge technology with creativity. With a growth mindset and a commitment to continuous learning, I’m always seeking opportunities to refine my skills and contribute to impactful projects that make a difference.
